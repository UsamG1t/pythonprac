In this paper, we consider periodic tasks in which the relative deadline of a task is equal
to its period, and the first instance of each periodic task is released at time 0. Table I lists
the task parameters used in this paper. A periodic task T
[k] has period P
[k]
and worst case
execution time WCET[k]
. The execution of T
[k]
requires one or more devices. We define
this set of devices as Φ[k]
. The optimal scaling factor that minimizes the system energy
consumption while executing T
[k]
is θ
[k]
. All task execution times are defined according to
the highest frequency of the DVS processor.
There are multiple instances of each task, and each instance has the same worst case
execution time and period, but has different arrival time, deadline and actual execution
time. To make the notation simple, we relabel all task instances in the scheduling profile
by label J indexed by a number indicating the order of execution. For instance, in Fig 2,
task J1 is the first instance of T
[1]
, J2 is the first instance of T
[2]
, J3 is the second instance of
T
[1]
, etc. J2 is preempted by task J3 and resumes after J3 finishes; the resumed part is still
deemed as part of J2 and not given a new label. Since task J3 is the second instance of task
T
[1]
, its period is P3 = 2min, WCET3 = 0.85min, arrival time is ai = 2min and deadline is
di = 4min.
