Abstractâ€”In this paper, we propose variable voltage task scheduling
algorithms that minimize energy or minimize peak power for the case
when the task arrival times, deadline times, execution times, periods,
and switching activities are given. We consider aperiodic (earliest due
date, earliest deadline first), as well as periodic (rate monotonic, earliest
deadline first) scheduling algorithms. We use the Lagrange multiplier
method to theoretically determine the relation between the task voltages
such that the energy or peak power is minimum, and then develop an
iterative algorithm that satisfies the relation. The asymptotic complexity of
the existing scheduling algorithms change very mildly with the application
of the proposed algorithms. We show experimentally (random experiments
as well as real-life cases), that the voltage assignment obtained by the
proposed low-complexity algorithm is very close to that of the optimal
energy (0.1% error) and optimal peak power (1% error) assignment.
