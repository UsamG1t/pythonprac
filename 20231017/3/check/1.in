Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a well-known low power design
technique that reduces the processor energy by slowing down the
DVS processor and stretching the task execution time. But in a
DVS system consisting of a DVS processor and multiple devices,
slowing down the processor increases the device energy consumption and thereby the system-level energy consumption. In this paper, we present dynamic task scheduling algorithms for periodic
tasks that minimize the system-level energy (CPU energy + device
standby energy). The algorithms use a combination of (i) optimal
speed setting, which is the speed that minimizes the system energy for a specific task, and (ii) limited preemption which reduces
the numbers of possible preemptions. For the case when the CPU
power and device power are comparable, these algorithms achieve
up to 43% energy savings compared to [1], but only up to 12% over
the non-DVS scheduling. If the device power is large compared to
the CPU power, we show that DVS should not be employed.
